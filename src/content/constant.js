    question: "How do native and hybrid apps differ from each other?",
    answer: `Native apps are developed specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). They offer optimal performance and access to all device features

    Hybrid apps are built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and run inside a native container. They can be deployed across multiple platforms but might not perform as well as native apps.`,
  },

    id: 2,
    question: "What is the typical timeframe for developing a mobile app?",
    answer:
      "The development time for a mobile app can vary widely based on the complexity of the app, the features required, and the development platform. On average, it can take anywhere from 3 to 9 months from the initial concept to deployment.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Which platforms should we prioritize: iOS or Android?",
    answer:
      "The choice of platform depends on your target audience. If your users are primarily iPhone users, targeting iOS makes sense. For a broader audience, consider developing for both iOS and Android. Cross-platform development tools can also help target both platforms simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is the estimated cost of developing a mobile app?",
    answer:
      "The cost of developing a mobile app depends on various factors, including the complexity of the app, the number of features, the design requirements, and the development time. It can range from a few thousand dollars for a simple app to hundreds of thousands for a complex, feature-rich application.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How do you guarantee the security of the mobile application?",
